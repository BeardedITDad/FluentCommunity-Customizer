## 📥 How to Use These Snippets

> These scripts are intended to be copy-pasted into your WordPress site's `functions.php` file.

Follow these steps:

### 🔧 Step-by-Step Instructions

#### 1. Access Your WordPress Theme Folder
- Go to your WordPress dashboard.
- Navigate to **Appearance > Theme File Editor**.
- On the right-hand side, click on `functions.php` under your active theme.

Alternatively, if you have FTP or file access:
- Navigate to:  
  `/wp-content/themes/your-active-theme/functions.php`

#### 2. Backup First (Optional but Recommended)
Before editing, make a quick backup of your existing `functions.php` file in case you need to roll back changes.

#### 3. Copy a Snippet
- Browse this repository and open the file that fits your need.
- Copy the entire PHP code block.

#### 4. Paste into `functions.php`
- Scroll to the bottom of your `functions.php` file (but before the closing `?>` tag if there is one).
- Paste the snippet you copied.

#### 5. Save Your Changes
- In the Theme Editor, click **Update File**.
- If using FTP, save the file and re-upload it to the server.

That’s it! Your new functionality should now be live.
